There are a number of gotchas when porting ANSI code to Z79Forth.

- FIND exists in both but with different semantics.
- MOVE exists in both but with different semantics. The ANSI MOVE operates
  on the basis of a byte count; 79-STANDARD operates on cells.
- The value returned by predicates for <TRUE> is different. ANSI and FORTH-83
  have -1, whereas 79-STANDARD has 1.
- PICK and ROLL arguments start at 1 in 79-STANDARD. They begin at 0 in ANSI
  and FORTH-83.

In general terms, it is a bad idea to redefine standard primitives and,
by default, Z79Forth will provide no warning when a primitive is redefined.
However, if such a feature is considered desirable, : can be redefined as:

: :
  >IN @
  FIND IF
    DUP >IN ! CR ." WARNING: " BL WORD COUNT TYPE
    SPACE ." redefined"
  THEN  
  >IN !
  :
; IMMEDIATE
