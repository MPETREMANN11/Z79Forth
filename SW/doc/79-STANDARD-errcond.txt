	An "Illegal argument" message is issued. Both stacks content are
	preserved.

."
The input stream is exhausted before " can be acquired.
	A "Missing delimiter" message is issued. In compilation context, the

	79-STANDARD does not make this an official error condition, I do.

	Both stacks content are preserved.

FORGET
( -- )
The input stream is exhausted before <name> can be acquired.

LITERAL
( n -- )
Notice.
	LITERAL is ignored in interpretation mode regardless of the data
	stack content. n will be dropped from the data stack.

LOAD
( u -- )
Notice.
	0 LOAD is ignored. U will be dropped.

PICK
( n1 -- n2 )
N1 is zero or negative.
	An "Illegal argument" message is issued. N1 is discarded from the
	data stack. The return stack content is preserved.

ROLL
( n1 -- n2 )
N1 is zero or negative.
	An "Illegal argument" message is issued. N1 is discarded from the
	data stack. The return stack content is preserved.

Further Error Related Considerations:
-------------------------------------
The division by zero situation is not handled as an error but as a hardware
trap. Upon execution of the error handler, the return stack will only be
cleared if the error/trap happened when compiling.
