LWVI is a (partial and incomplete) implementation of Bill Joy's VI. It is
written in Forth and can be found in the software distribution under
Z79Forth/SW/examples/lwvi.4th. That code has not been blockified yet, as some
very important features in the 'delete' department are still missing.

Worth mentioning is the fact that this particular VI flavour was designed to
operate on standard 1 KB Forth blocks. This leads to some quirks and
limitations. In particular, JOIN and DOT are not supported. In essence, LWVI
endeavours to maintain a consistent mapping between a screen visualized as 16
lines by 64 characters and a 1 KB block.

The whole thing was originally developed under GNU Forth and mate-terminal,
which is believed to implement proper VT100 emulation. No esoteric features
were used in the process. The actual target is Minicom 2.7.1 VT102 mode with
BS mapped to BS. The ultimate reference, wrt. terminal programming can be found
at https://vt100.net/docs/vt102-ug/.

At any given time, LWVI operates operates in one of three modes:

- command (the status bar at line 18 is blank).
- insert (the status bar displays -- INSERT).
- replace (the status bar displays -- REPLACE).

The editor is invoked by:

<blocknumber> EDIT

The default mode on entry is the command mode. The insert mode is accessed
by typing 'i'. the replace mode is accessed by typing 'R'. Both are exited
by typing <ESC>.
