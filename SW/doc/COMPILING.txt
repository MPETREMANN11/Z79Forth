Z79Forth is intended to be compiled with William Astle's LW Tools cross
development tools. It is made publicly available for download at
http://www.lwtools.ca/. The current version, as of this writing, is 4.17.

The preferred development platform is Linux. The Makefile is the src
directory assumes that lwasm is reachable somewhere in your PATH. By default
it builds an Intel ihex ROM image and an LST file which can be extremely handy
when debugging.

When building a new image, be sure to have defined all the tunable parameters
available in src/constants.asm. Of particular importance, with respect to the
accuracy of the MS primitive, is the value of the MSLCNT constant, because
it depends on the processor clock's frequency.

Tunable Build Time Parameters Description
-----------------------------------------
Those are defined in src/constants.asm. They are:

Name	Default	Alternative	Description
CSSNTVE	0	NZ		Select 0 for a case insensitive implementation
				or 1 for a case sensitive one. In case sensitive
				mode, those digits encoded by a letter _must_
				be entered as upper case. Be also aware that
				all the predefined dictionary words are stored
				in ROM as upper case characters.
DEBUG	0	NZ		If non-zero, extra validation code will be
				added to the assembled .hex image. This is
				most useful when developing but should not be
				used for producing production ROM images.
				CAUTION: if SSDFEAT and RELFEAT are enabled
				(see below), you will not be able to fit a
				DEBUG image into an 8 KB EEPROM!
CKOVRUN	0	NZ		Set this to a non-zero to check for overruns
				in GETCH (see src/console.asm). Experimentally,
				overruns have never been observed at 115200 bps.
USEDP	1	0		Use the direct page addressing mode whenever
				extended addressing mode is requested and
				the target address is in the appropriate range.
				By default, that appropriate range is coded as
				[VARSPC, VARSPC+$FF] where VARSPC is $100.
				This particular RAM area contains most of the
				essential global variables. Setting USEDP to
				0 is not recommended in any way.
SSDFEAT	1	0		Setting this tunable to 1 enables the 'symbolic
				stack dump' feature. This will result in
				priceless symbolic information to be displayed
				by the error handler after a run time error has
				occurred. A dump of the system stack will be
				provided regardless of the value of this
				tunable parameter since return addresses in
				Z79Forth are stored in the system stack, as
				opposed to the return stack in more traditional
				implementations.
				Only if SSDFEAT is non-zero will SwiftForth's .'
				primitive be available in the dictionary.
RELFEAT	1	0		Setting this tunable to a non-zero value
				enables the 'reliability' feature. When the
				feature is on, an extra byte is added to
				every word in the dictionary. That byte is
				statically defined to be $C7 (an illegal opcode)
				for ROM resident words. For RAM resident words,
				starting with the builtin @, it will hold a
				CRC of the code section of the word it relates
				to. Not all newly defined words are subject to
				this treatment. : defined and CONSTANTs are by
				default. CREATEd words may optionally be applied
				the MONITOR suffix if the checksum is to be
				computed after they have been defined. This
				is reasonable to use if their contents is not
				expected to change. An integrity check of the
				monitored words can be triggered by resorting
				to the ICHECK word.
				Only if RELFEAT is non-zero will the MONITOR
				and ICHECK primitives be available in the
				dictionary.
MSLCNT	994	794, any	This is a loop count used by the MS primitive.
				994 is appropriate for a 5 MHz system operating
				in 6309 native mode. 794 is appropriate for a 4
				MHz system operating in 6309 native mode. Any
				other value might be used as a result of a
				calibration process.
