Z79Forth 79-STANDARD Compliance Document

This whole implementation assumes that the Z79Forth reference board is used.
Kicad 5 schematics and the corresponding PDF file are included in this
distribution. The reference board may also be called the validated use case.

1. System dictionary space
--------------------------
Z79Forth is designed to reside in ROM. System dictionary entries have
intertwined dependencies that are such that, even if implemented in RAM,
would not be fully independently forgettable. This is not considered
an issue since predefined words can always be overridden by user defined
words.

The validated ROM use case uses an AT28C64B-15PU EEPROM (8 KB, 150ns access
time, industrial temperature range). An AT28C64B-15PC might be used as an
alternative in the consumer grade temperature range (0 to 70 degrees Celcius),
although that part is difficult to source these days. Additional words can
always be loaded from the mass storage device (see 5. below).

Be aware that the data retention period of the AT28C64B is only guaranteed
for 10 years. If you absolutely need to go to space with this, keep that in
mind!

2. Application dictionary space
-------------------------------
Upon system initialization, the ROM based flavor of '@' is relocated to
SRAM, starting at the address WDICSPC (see constants.asm for details).

In the validated use case, where a NEC 43256AC-10L SRAM (32KB, 100ns access
time) is used, this leaves 32 KB minus the space used for buffer memory and
system stack storage. 27 KB seems like a conservative estimation.

3. Data stack
-------------
The data stack size is configurable through the NSTKSZ tunable parameter
(defined in constants.asm) and expressed in bytes. It defaults to 192 (96
cells). The upper limit is only constrained by the SRAM size.

4. Return stack
---------------
The return stack size is configurable through the RSTKSZ tunable parameter
(defined in constants.asm) and expressed in bytes. It defaults to 128
(64 cells). The RPICKN implementation contraints it to be no higher than 254
bytes. This puts an upper limit on the number of screens that can be chained
through LOAD. For every chained screen, two cells will be stacked up on the
return stack.

5. Mass storage contiguous block quantity required
--------------------------------------------------
The mass storage device used by the Z79Forth reference board is a SanDisk
CompactFlash device programmed in 8 bit mode. There is no minimum storage
requirement. Z79Forth will work even in the absence of a CF card. The maximum
number of addressable blocks is the full range of unsigned block numbers
(64 MB).

6. An operator's terminal
-------------------------
In the validated use case, this is provided by an HD63B50 ACIA whose base
address is defined by ACIACTL and ACIADAT (see constants.asm).

The default ACIA settings assume a 1.84320 MHz oscillator, optionally divided
by 3 through a pair of D type latches. The baud rate is further divided by 16
by chip configuration, thus resulting in a 115200 bps line rate (8N1 is also
programmed). However, reliability problems have been observed when repeatedly
cut & pasting large blocks of text at very short time intervals. The divide
by 3 path (38400 bps operation) is highly recommended.

RTS/CTS flow control is implemented on input. Asynchronous serial input is
interrupt driven. Character input is queued to a 64 byte FIFO and dequeued
whenever GETCH is invoked. Character output supports software flow control
(XON/OFF).

The preferred user interface to the ACIA is Minicom under Linux (other options
might work as well, YMMV). An input line will be considered as terminated upon
reception of a CR character (hex $0D). No extra LF (hex $0A) character is
expected. The input processing routine provides support for cooked input.
Supported control codes are:

- erase (^H) implements the traditional backspace semantics.
- kill (^U) erases all characters up to the beginning of the line, in a Unix
  like manner.
- intr (^C) interrupts the normal flow of execution and resumes control in
  the error handler, as if ABORT had been called from Forth code.

The recommended terminal size is 25 lines by 80 columns. DUMP (see examples/
dump.4th) assumes 80 columns are available. LWVI only requires 18 lines by 64
columns.
