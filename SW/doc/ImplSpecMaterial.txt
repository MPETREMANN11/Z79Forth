Most primitives implemented in Z79Forth/A conform to the relevant standard
specification. A few primitives are non standard at all. Please check
SW/doc/all-words.txt for a description of those non-standard words.
Also check SW/doc/COMPILING.txt if the doc subdirectory, as there are a few
system tunable parameters that can alter the system's behaviour.

If a CompactFlash card is detected at system bootup time, block #1 will be
automatically loaded. If the code loaded from there never relinquishes control
back to the interpreter (endless loop through the use of BYE), interrupt
support should be enabled.

In case of an error (or trap/interrupt), the error handler will display the
context in which the error occurred. Error particulars will be as follows:

<Error message> (xxxx/yyyy)
<optional system stack dump> if SSDFEAT was enabled at compilation time.

Where:

xxxx is the HEX represention of BLK @
yyyy is the HEX representation of >IN @

at the time the exception was triggered.

Important notice:
-----------------
On error:
- BASE is reset to decimal.
- the return stack is cleared.
- the data stack is cleared because the control stack is implemented on the
  top of it.
