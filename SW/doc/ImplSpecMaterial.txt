Most primitives implemented in Z79Forth conform to the relevant standard
specification. A few primitives are non standard at all. Please check
doc/79-STANDARD-subset.txt for a description of those non-standard words.
Also check doc/COMPILING.txt if the doc subdirectory, as the CONVERT primitive
may or may not be available--it is not included in the interrupt enabled
implementation, due to resource constraints.

If a CompactFlash card is detected at system bootup time, block #1 will be
automatically loaded. If the code loaded from there never relinquishes control
back to the interpreter (endless loop through the use of BYE), interrupt
support should be enabled.

In case of an error (or trap/interrupt), the error handler will display the
context in which the error occurred. Error particulars will be as follows:

<Error message> (xxxx/yyyy)
<optional system stack dump> if SSDFEAT was enabled at compilation time.

Where:

xxxx is the HEX represention of BLK @
yyyy is the HEX representation in >IN @

at the time the expection was triggered.

Important notice:
-----------------
On error BASE is reset to the default (10).
