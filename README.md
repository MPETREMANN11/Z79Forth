# Z79Forth
This project has a hardware component and a software component.

- hardware: an Hitachi 63C09 based single board computer, aka the "reference Z79Forth board."
- software: a 79-STANDARD sub-set implementation entirely written in assembly language.

Additionally, some sample application programs and benchmarks are provided. Please note that
the GPL version 3 only applies to the assembly code. The schematics (which will be uploaded
later) and the Forth source code are released in the public domain.
